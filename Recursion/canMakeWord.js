/**
 * Problem description: Write a function can construct that accepts a target string and an array of strings return a boolean 
 * that denotes whether the target string can be constructed by using the concatinated words in the word bank. You can reuse the elements of 
 * word bank as you need. 
 
 * Inputs: Â Target word, as well as a word bank
 * Outputs: a boolean that states if the word can be made  
 
 * Limits: The letters can only be drawn from the word bank, you can return a boolean. 
 * Datastructures: A tree as well as the call stack 
 * Strategy: basically go through the word bank and if you manage to find the starting word remove it and continue until you cannot 
 * create the word anymore or you reach an empty string.
